. The HMC (Hybris Management Console)

The HMC is the first generation of backoffice. In th e HMC you can manage almost anything in Hybris, it is really close the database.
It is the more powerful backoffice but also the more complex and difficult to understand and use properly.
That's why the HMC should be used by administrators or technical users.
